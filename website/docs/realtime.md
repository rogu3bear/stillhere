# Realtime and WebSockets

For a newly named application, follow [Adopting the starter](adopting.md).
Provider credentials and the governed/standalone distinction are in
[Credential profiles](credentials.md). Runtime invariants remain required
after replacing field-guide pages or labels.

This template includes one explicit WebSocket lane so production agents do not have to infer how realtime traffic should enter the app.

## Routing Contract

The generated `build/_worker.js` is the Cloudflare entrypoint. It routes requests in this order:

1. WebSocket upgrades for `/realtime/socket` go to the template WebSocket capability endpoint.
2. WebSocket upgrades for any other path return `404`.
3. Plain HTTP requests to `/realtime/socket` return `426 Upgrade Required`.
4. Static assets, including app icons and the web manifest, go to `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)`.
5. Everything else goes to the Leptos Worker handler for SSR, deep routes, and server functions.

Only step 5 enters the application telemetry contract. The shim creates a custom span with the closed boundary `ssr` or `server_function`; the Rust handler emits one closed, versioned completion event. Asset names and WebSocket route material therefore do not leak into that contract, and no raw URL, query, identifier, header, cookie, body, IP/user-agent value, D1 identity, or internal error text is logged.

Do not put WebSocket handling behind Leptos client navigation. A browser may do a full document request before hydration, and Cloudflare decides whether the Worker sees the request before any Rust or Leptos router code runs.

## Template Endpoint

`/realtime/socket` is a capability check, not an application feature. It accepts the upgrade, sends a JSON `ready` message, and closes cleanly.

Use it to verify that:

- Cloudflare routes WebSocket upgrades to the Worker.
- The `_worker.js` router keeps WebSocket traffic out of static assets.
- CSP allows `ws:` and `wss:` through `connect-src`.

## Production Rule

Use the template endpoint only for simple request-scoped upgrades and local capability proof.

Use Durable Objects for:

- rooms
- chat
- presence
- collaboration
- fanout
- reconnect state
- long-lived coordination
- any shared state across clients

The durable pattern is one Durable Object per room, document, tenant, or other coordination key. The Worker should authenticate the request, derive the object ID, forward the WebSocket upgrade to that object, and let the object own connection state.

## Shared-State Pattern

Use [Realtime Durable Object](../patterns/realtime-durable-object/) when `/realtime/socket` needs shared state. The example keeps the core route contract but changes the implementation from "accept and close" to:

1. Worker validates the WebSocket upgrade and session.
2. Worker derives a stable room/document key.
3. Worker calls `env.REALTIME_ROOM.getByName(key).fetch(request)`.
4. Durable Object accepts the server socket with `ctx.acceptWebSocket(server)`.
5. Durable Object persists important events before broadcasting to `ctx.getWebSockets(room)`.

The required Wrangler binding and migration are documented in `patterns/realtime-durable-object/wrangler.durable-object.example.toml`. Do not add that binding to the core template unless the application adopts the pattern.

## Agent Checklist

Before adding realtime behavior, answer these in the PR or implementation notes:

- What is the WebSocket route?
- Is this request-scoped or shared state?
- If shared state exists, which Durable Object owns it?
- What authenticates the upgrade?
- What closes idle or unauthorized sockets?
- What happens on reconnect?
- Which command proves the route still builds and the shim still contains the WebSocket lane?

Minimum local proof:

```bash
bash ./scripts/build-edge.sh
bun ./scripts/verify-worker-runtime.mjs
bunx wrangler@4.120.1 deploy --dry-run
```
