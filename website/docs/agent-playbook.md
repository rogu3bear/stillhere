# Agent Playbook: leptos-cf

Instruction set for AI coding agents working on this Leptos + Cloudflare Workers + D1 starter. Follows the repository conventions established in the codebase. Read this before making any changes.

---

## 1. Prerequisites Check

Run the dependency checker first:

```bash
./scripts/check-deps.sh
```

Expected output: every line starts with `[ok]`. Any `[missing]` line is a hard blocker.

If it fails, run the bootstrap script:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

Bootstrap installs: stable Rust toolchain, `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, `cargo-leptos`, `worker-build`, and the repo-local `wasm-bindgen-cli` resolved from `Cargo.lock`. It requires `rustup`, `cargo`, and `bun` to already be present. If those are missing, the script exits with an error message that names the missing tool.

After bootstrap, re-run `check-deps.sh` and confirm all checks pass.

Local development needs no provider credential. For this operator workspace's production lane only, verify the Cloudflare account identity and the dedicated short-lived profile:

```bash
test -n "${CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID:-}"
export LEPTOS_CF_PROFILE="your-short-lived-profile"
cfctl auth import-api-token \
  --profile "$LEPTOS_CF_PROFILE" \
  --account "$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  --value-in "<mode-0600-token-file>" --json
cfctl auth status "$LEPTOS_CF_PROFILE" --json
```

If the short-lived child is already installed, omit import and check its status.
Require `ok: true`, `result.credential_available: true`, `result.profile.id`
equal to `$LEPTOS_CF_PROFILE`, and `result.profile.account_id` equal to
`$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. Exit 0 alone does not establish credential availability;
this local check does not establish provider permissions. Governed calls use
cfctl's selected secret store. Repo-local `.env` credentials belong only to the
separate standalone Wrangler lane. Never hardcode or print the token. The account
token-minter credential does not enter this repository or deployment profile.

---

## 2. Governed Production Bootstrap

For credential-free local startup, use README Quick Start. For independent
standalone production operation, use `docs/credentials.md` and the portable
Wrangler lane. The sequence below is for this operator workspace only.
After `scripts/init.sh`, substitute the adopted names from Cargo/Wrangler and
the operation ID in `.cfctl/operations/d1-migrations.toml`. Read them before the
commands below:

```bash
LEPTOS_D1_NAME=$(bun -e 'console.log(Bun.TOML.parse(await Bun.file("wrangler.toml").text()).d1_databases[0].database_name)')
LEPTOS_MIGRATION_ID=$(bun -e 'console.log(Bun.TOML.parse(await Bun.file(".cfctl/operations/d1-migrations.toml").text()).operation[0].id)')
```

### 2.1 Read or create the D1 database through cfctl

First bind and audit the checkout/account, then query by the exact database name:

```bash
cfctl workspace add "$PWD" --account "$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" --json
cfctl workspace audit --json
cfctl call d1-list-databases \
  --selector "account_id=$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  --query "name=$LEPTOS_D1_NAME" \
  --profile "$LEPTOS_CF_PROFILE" \
  --json
```

If no exact-name database exists, prepare a create plan:

```bash
bun -e 'const name = Bun.TOML.parse(await Bun.file("wrangler.toml").text()).d1_databases[0].database_name; console.log(JSON.stringify({name, read_replication: {mode: "disabled"}}))' | \
  cfctl call d1-create-database \
    --selector "account_id=$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" \
    --profile "$LEPTOS_CF_PROFILE" \
    --body-stdin \
    --json
```

This returns a preview operation. Inspect its selectors, body, cost, rollback, workspace impact, and content hash; obtain explicit approval; then run `cfctl plans approve`, `cfctl plans run`, and `cfctl plans status` for that exact operation. Extract the UUID only from successful provider verification:

```
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "leptos-cf-db"
database_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Do not create a duplicate after a name lookup, and do not install an ID from plan intent alone.

### 2.2 Derive the ignored production config

Keep tracked `wrangler.toml` provider-neutral. Derive `wrangler.production.toml` only after Worker/D1 names and the D1 UUID have been read back from the provider:

```bash
bun ./scripts/write-production-config.mjs \
  --worker <verified-worker-name> \
  --database <verified-d1-name> \
  --database-id <verified-d1-uuid>
```

The generator rejects partial or invalid identity, an already-bound source template, Pages/`env.production` drift, and missing runtime invariants. It changes only the Worker name, D1 name, and both D1 UUID fields. The output is gitignored and must never become a second tracked source of truth.

### 2.3 Apply migrations

Apply to the local SQLite replica first:

```bash
CI=1 bunx wrangler@4.120.1 d1 migrations apply "$LEPTOS_D1_NAME" --local
```

Remote schema application is a production data write. Use the ID in `$LEPTOS_MIGRATION_ID`, the repository-owned operation that binds the clean canonical root and HEAD, every ordered migration blob, operation-pack blob, production-config hash and database identity, a fresh pre-change recovery bookmark, the Wrangler migration ledger, and closed schema readback. Generic D1 import/query paths are not substitutes. If the operation fails closed, stop and resolve its contract; do not bypass it with direct Wrangler or raw SQL.

Prepare its exact plan with the same account and profile:

```bash
cfctl call "$LEPTOS_MIGRATION_ID" \
  --selector "account_id=$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  --selector "database_id=<verified-d1-uuid>" \
  --query config=wrangler.production.toml \
  --profile "$LEPTOS_CF_PROFILE" \
  --json
```

The migrations create the `todos` and `contact_submissions` tables plus their indexes. Verify with:

```bash
bunx wrangler@4.120.1 d1 execute "$LEPTOS_D1_NAME" --local --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"
```

Expected: `todos` and `contact_submissions` appear in the result.

### 2.4 Build

```bash
bash ./scripts/build-edge.sh
```

This runs the full edge build pipeline: `cargo-leptos` compiles the hydration bundle, `scripts/hash-assets.mjs` fingerprints the client JS/CSS/WASM and updates the SSR asset constants, `worker-build` compiles the Worker bundle, and `scripts/write-worker-shim.mjs` generates the configured Workers entrypoint. Output lands in `target/site/` and `build/`. Expect several minutes on first run due to dependency compilation.

Decision point: if the build fails with a `wasm-bindgen` version mismatch error, see section 7 (Troubleshooting).

### 2.5 Verify the build artifact

```bash
bunx wrangler@4.120.1 deploy --dry-run
```

This validates the `wrangler.toml` config and the build output without uploading anything. Expected output ends with `Total Upload:` and does not contain `error`.

### 2.6 Deploy through a reviewed plan

```bash
cfctl call wrangler.deploy \
  --account "$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  --profile "$LEPTOS_CF_PROFILE" \
  --query "config=$PWD/wrangler.production.toml" \
  --query "name=<verified-worker-name>" \
  --query "message=<exact-source-and-artifact-identity-from-cfctl>" \
  --json
```

Use the exact Worker name from provider readback and the exact source/artifact
identity cfctl requires for this clean source and build. A mismatched message
fails plan preparation and reports the required value; review that value and
repeat preparation with it. Do not reuse the
identity after either changes. The returned plan keeps its selected profile and
account through approval, execution, and status. That command prepares a
hash-bound deployment plan. After reviewing and explicitly approving the exact operation, use `cfctl plans run` and `cfctl plans status`. Then independently read back the Worker version, compatibility date, bindings, assets, routes, and observability settings and test the field-guide routes plus the `/lab` D1 write path. Plan completion is not live behavior proof.

---

## 3. Adding a Feature

Use this checklist. Work through it top to bottom; each item that applies requires changes before the next item.

**Do you need a new database table?**
- Create `migrations/NNNN_<name>.sql` (increment N from the last migration file).
- Apply local: `bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply "$LEPTOS_D1_NAME" --local`
- Apply remote after the feature is complete and tested locally.

**Do you need a new server function?**
- Declare the types in `src/api.rs`: request struct (if needed) and response type. Both must derive `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `Clone`.
- Add the `#[server(...)]` function in `src/api.rs`. The body must be wrapped in `SendWrapper::new(async move { ... }).await` — see existing server functions for the exact pattern.
- Add the database implementation function in `src/server/todos.rs` (or a new file under `src/server/`). Register any new module in `src/server/mod.rs`.
- Server functions call `use_context::<AppState>()` via the `database()` helper in `todos.rs`. Do not use global state.

**Do you need a new page or route?**
- Create the component file in `src/components/<name>.rs`.
- Export it from `src/components/mod.rs`.
- Add a `<Route path=... view=YourComponent/>` in `src/app.rs` inside the existing `<Routes>` block.

**Do you need new styles?**
- Add CSS to `style/main.css`. There is no Tailwind; write plain CSS. Match the existing naming conventions (BEM-adjacent, lowercase kebab).

**After every change:**
- Run the verification protocol in section 6 before considering the feature done.

## 5. File Ownership Map

Before editing any file, confirm it matches the kind of change you are making.

| What you are changing | File(s) to edit |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Shared types, server function signatures | `src/api.rs` |
| D1 query logic | `src/server/todos.rs`, `src/server/contact.rs` (or new file in `src/server/`) |
| New server submodule | `src/server/mod.rs` — add `pub mod <name>` |
| UI components | `src/components/<name>.rs` |
| New component exports | `src/components/mod.rs` |
| Route definitions | `src/app.rs` |
| CSS styles | `style/main.css` |
| Database schema | `migrations/NNNN_<name>.sql` (new file, never edit applied migrations) |
| Portable Cloudflare bindings (D1, KV, R2, etc.) | tracked `wrangler.toml` |
| Provider identity | derived, gitignored `wrangler.production.toml`; never hand-edit tracked identity |
| Governed remote migration contract | `.cfctl/operations/d1-migrations.toml` plus append-only `migrations/*.sql` |
| WebSocket ingress contract | `scripts/write-worker-shim.mjs`, `docs/realtime.md` |
| Shared realtime state | `patterns/realtime-durable-object/` first, then `wrangler.toml` and `scripts/write-worker-shim.mjs` when adopting |
| Local dev secrets | `.dev.vars` (create if absent; never commit this file) |
| Production secrets | `bunx wrangler secret put ...` (stored in CF, not in files) |
| Worker entry point + app state wiring | `src/server/state.rs`, `src/lib.rs` |
| Rust dependencies | `Cargo.toml` |

Do not edit `src/lib.rs` for feature work. It contains only the Worker `fetch` entry point and the WASM `hydrate` export. Change it only if the routing or app state wiring needs to change.

The public `/contact` route is intentionally local to the template: it validates and persists submissions to D1, applies session-scoped submission caps, and relies on the Worker `/api/*` origin guard before Leptos server functions dispatch. It does not send email, webhooks, or third-party API calls without an explicit integration.

The public `/realtime/socket` route is intentionally a Worker-level capability lane. Keep request-scoped demos in the generated shim; move rooms, presence, collaboration, fanout, reconnect state, or other shared state to `patterns/realtime-durable-object/` before adding Durable Object bindings.

---

## 6. Verification Protocol

For day-to-day iteration, use this lighter sequence:

```bash
# Step 1: Fast type-check for SSR
cargo check --features ssr

# Step 2: Full edge build + verifiers
bash ./scripts/build-edge.sh

# Step 3: Deployment structure validation
bunx wrangler@4.120.1 deploy --dry-run
```

Before pushing or declaring a change complete, run the full release readiness verification instead:

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

This is the authoritative local sequence documented in `RELEASE.md`.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

## Realtime/WebSocket Rule

WebSocket traffic enters above Leptos. Do not add realtime features by relying on client-side navigation, browser history behavior, or a Leptos component mounting at the right time.

Use the explicit `/realtime/socket` lane from the generated `_worker.js` for request-scoped capability checks. If the feature has rooms, presence, collaboration, fanout, reconnect state, or any shared state across clients, introduce a Durable Object and document the object key.

Required proof after touching realtime routing:

```bash
bash ./scripts/build-edge.sh
bun ./scripts/verify-worker-runtime.mjs
bunx wrangler@4.120.1 deploy --dry-run
```

**`error: wasm-bindgen version mismatch`**

The `wasm-bindgen-cli` version must match what `Cargo.lock` resolves. The production build wraps both `cargo leptos` and `worker-build` with `scripts/with-wasm-bindgen-cli.sh`, which installs the lockfile-matched CLI under `var/cargo-tools/` and puts it first on `PATH` for every WASM-producing phase.

Check the repo-local version:
```bash
./scripts/with-wasm-bindgen-cli.sh --version
```

Fix — refresh the repo-local tool and rerun the build:
```bash
rm -rf var/cargo-tools/wasm-bindgen-*
bash ./scripts/build-edge.sh
```

---

**`the trait Send is not implemented for ...` / `not Send` errors in server functions**

Cloudflare Workers use a single-threaded runtime. The `worker` crate types (`D1Database`, `Env`, etc.) are not `Send`. Leptos server functions require `Send` futures by default.

The fix is already demonstrated in `src/api.rs`: wrap the async block with `SendWrapper::new(async move { ... }).await`. Every server function body that touches `AppState` or D1 must use this wrapper.

```rust
#[server(MyFn)]
pub async fn my_fn() -> Result<MyType, ServerFnError> {
    #[cfg(feature = "ssr")]
    {
        send_wrapper::SendWrapper::new(async move {
            crate::server::my_module::my_impl()
                .await
                .map_err(crate::server::server_error)
        })
        .await
    }
    #[cfg(not(feature = "ssr"))]
    {
        unreachable!("server functions only execute on the server")
    }
}
```

---

**`no such table: todos` at runtime**

For local development, apply the local migration:

```bash
bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply "$LEPTOS_D1_NAME" --local
```

For production, inspect the provider schema and prepare the repository-owned operation read from `.cfctl/operations/d1-migrations.toml`. If it is blocked, stop and resolve that contract rather than running a direct remote command.

---

**`wrangler.toml contains placeholder D1 IDs`**

This is the required tracked-template state, not a warning. If a production command fails because it used the template, you skipped step 2.2 or omitted `--config wrangler.production.toml`. Re-derive the ignored file only from a live `d1-list-databases` receipt or verified `d1-create-database` readback.

---

**`module not found` after adding a new source file**

Rust requires explicit module registration. If you created `src/server/my_module.rs`, add `pub mod my_module;` to `src/server/mod.rs`. If you created `src/components/my_page.rs`, add `pub mod my_page;` to `src/components/mod.rs`. The compiler error will name the missing declaration.

---

**`Missing app state in Leptos server function context`**

`AppState` is injected into the Leptos context in `src/lib.rs` via `.leptos_routes_with_context`. If you see this error, the server function ran outside the context scope — this should not happen unless you modified `src/lib.rs`. Do not call server implementation functions from outside a server function.

---

**`D1 reported no rows changed during toggle/delete`**

The requested todo ID does not exist. This is a logic error in the caller, not an infrastructure issue. Verify the ID being passed to `toggle_todo` or `delete_todo` exists in the database.

## Application adoption

Use `docs/adopting.md` for the supported name and page cutover. The initializer
preserves application code and schema. `Cargo.toml` selects reference-site
checks explicitly; shared runtime/security checks remain required for every
adopter. The complete gate now requires cargo-audit; absence fails before build.
